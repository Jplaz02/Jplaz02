# 👋 Hey, I'm JL — Welcome to Syntax Plaza

I'm a recent CS graduate relearning with intention.  
I used to code without really understanding — now I'm learning with clarity, curiosity, and care.

**Syntax Plaza** is my space to grow, experiment, and document the process.  
I believe progress takes time — and I’m okay with that.

## 🌱 What I'm About

- Learning deeply, not just memorizing
- Building things I understand and enjoy
- Staying curious about how things work
- Growing at my own pace, with purpose

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Learning Path

I'm still learning, but here's the direction I'm taking:

- **Frontend**: Starting with the basics — currently focused on learning **React**  
  → Planning to explore **Next.js** as I grow

- **Automation**: Curious about **n8n** for workflow automation and integration  
  → Not there yet, but excited to learn how it fits into full-stack systems

- **Backend & Tools**: Open to exploring whatever helps me build better — whether it's Node.js, Express, or something new

- **Other Tools**: Git, GitHub, VS Code — and anything that supports clarity and creativity

I'm learning at my own pace, with intention.  
Open to other stacks when the time, need, and learning support align.
